SOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!,grail
"ARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.",grail
SOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?,grail
ARTHUR: Yes!,grail
SOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!,grail

SOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?,grail
ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!,grail

"ARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.",grail
"SOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?",grail
ARTHUR: Please!,grail
SOLDIER #1: Am I right?,grail
ARTHUR: I'm not interested!,grail
SOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!,grail

Good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length. VA showing through. On the downhill slope. Just ****,wine
Just about holding together - drying out a touch at the finish. Not as good as I thought this would be.  A good ***,wine
In your face wine - rather obvious and simple (although some structure did begin to show through). ***,wine

"Very vinous - Burgundy with bubbles, to some extent and so a bit much in some ways.  I suspect it needs time to mellow - it will be interesting to see how this develops (this bottle was disgorged only last year).   If all goes well ***(*)",wine
"All quite refined and delicate, appley pinot fruit, autolytic flavours. Another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars (credit the producer for an excellent back label), it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality. Perhaps this will develop but for now a good ***",wine
Good fruit - nice acidity. Pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - I fear it may go down the Ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours.  Top  **,wine
Curiously Sauvignon-like - quite rich. Odd balance - people were saying this is a vineyard Huet took on and then abandoned. Good wine but it doesn't seem to have the class of their major wines. A low **(*),wine
"Pretty nice.   Clean, rich, yet decently taught.  A credit to the appelation. Bare ***",wine
A weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle - one sips for a while but then abandons it. I have had much better. Not Rated,wine
Very light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated. I have had better bottles.  ***,wine
"Dry, savoury, quite succulent. Pleasantly high-toned, nervy, and a bit awkward.  A wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable. ***",wine
"Curiously quiet, but concentration and fruit quality are all there.  Maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air.  ***",wine
"Leafy, dry, decent balance. Good wine but I doubt it's going anywhere much.  Pleasant, and perhaps it would reward further attention.  **",wine
"Quite baked, decent concentration - slightly hot finish. I recall having had better from this producer.  **",wine
"Refined, smooth sweet (to a controlled extent) - very drinkable. Forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the New World reds, to my palate. Top ***",wine
"Huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather.   I find this a bit much. Returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit  and to be a substantial wine in its way, although I find it hard to decide about it. Many will admire this, and I may too given time to consider it - I had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed.  I think I'll reserve judgement for now. Not Rated",wine
"A bit anonymous in some ways, but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine - from the South of France somewhere, I guess. I suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis ***",wine
"Beautifully refined.  Complex, elegant, long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer. Lovely.   ****",wine
Eccentric - very rancio - complex and interesting - I need more time with this but for now  ***,wine

"Soft, cigar cassis fruit - sweet finish. Pleasant. Nice condition. ***",wine
Soft blackcurrant fruit - with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate. Odd balance. **,wine
A bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old Barolo oxidativeness.  Tarry - quite hard work. Actually probably good. Top ***,wine

"A slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage (1990 or 1996), possibly Krug, possibly Billecart. Lovely wine whatever. A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes. Elegant, good length and fine balanced acidity. A really good, cheap (under 15) fizz. ****",wine
Mature with Grenache cherry showing through. Charming nose. Slightly simple on the palate. A good ***,wine
"Slightly flat liquorice nose. More depth than the 98. Closed up and allowing the alcohol to  show through, but I think this will come together well. ***(*)",wine
A touch gummy and with a hint of leather. Drier than many. Robust. ****,wine
Youthful (obviously the youngest wine of this flight). Powerful wine with lovely softy tannins at the end. **(**),wine
"Past its peak, although still very drinkable. Fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing. **",wine
"This vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines, but was also maturing well - at an in-between phase I guess. ***",wine
Corked. Not Rated,wine
"Green tannins, dry at the end, a long, soft, not that pleasant leathery length. ***",wine
Vegetal blackcurrant. Soft and not together. **,wine
Very young and closed. Minty. But does it have the structure? ***,wine
"A stinky nose to start with. Leather, and just beginning to dry out. ***",wine
"a touch vegetal, and some volatility. Just ***",wine
"a bit of blackcurrant, clean and nicely together. A top ***",wine
Some thought this stunk rather. I thought it the finest wine of this flight. Lovely fragrant mature Shiraz nose. At peak. Good. ****,wine

Cream crackers on the nose (no that's not rhyming slang). Vanilla. Simple. ***,wine
"Quite acidic, some fruit. A solid ***",wine

"On the whole, well made stuff, but there does seem to be an odd dull metallic note to the wine. Otherwise there is soft, well-balanced fruit. **",wine
"A good, fruity, balanced drink. Pleasant food or quaffing wine.***",wine
"The usual Penfold's style - well made, and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance. ***",wine
,wine
"Dry, clean, nice piney (is that allowed?)  spicy perhaps is better. Reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served. Decent length. Top **",wine
Nice white-pepper spicyness - balanced and long - the extreme nature of the vintage less apparent than I feared.  **(*),wine
Honied - interesting green-tinged high-toned fruit.  Bone-dry and rather nice.  Time to drink though. Bare ***,wine

"Intense pure cassis, ripe with some quite dry succulent tannins.  Fairly sweet impression on the palate. **",wine
Sickly toffee-fudge nose. Sweet fruit.  I don't like this. *,wine
Sweet soft-drink fruit.  It expands a bit but I still find it too soft.  For somebody who likes the style: ***,wine
"Very sweet, some mushroomyness but so sickly - might almost be a desert wine.  I really don't want to drink this. I can't even bring myself to give it stars on an ""if you like this sort of thing"" basis. No Stars",wine
Quite sweet - very soft fruit. Herby and lifted. Decent *,wine
Still a bit soft for my palate - has Mt E always been this easy?  Certainly the best of the three. Bare ***,wine
Almost Madeira-like.   It suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty. Pleasant but fading a bit. **,wine
"Almost dry - nice, but no better than  it should be given the reputation of the vintage.  ***",wine
,wine
"Very classic cedary, mature Claret nose.  Classic on the palate too, but there is an air of living dangerously, of corruption, and a general hint that the wine will crack up.  Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two.  ***",wine
"Classic again on the nose, but a rather fresher, more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit.   Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned.  Drinking well and no hurry to consume.  ****",wine
This was one of three Chapel Down wines (and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers) supplied by the winery.,wine
"I don't get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays, although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there. I can't say I miss it much. This wine is floral, grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon-like flavours. Strangely for a cleanly made 11% white wine, it isn't the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it's not unpleasant, just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds. Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting. *",wine
"Does wine travel well? This Champagne seems to have. Packing the car recently, I opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when I found - to my surprise - a bottle already in there. This, I worked out, had been in the car for the last couple of months (going everywhere the car went - a thousand miles or so - in the cold and in the warm). Unfortunately I didn't have another, untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion.",wine
"Lovely fizz, with good nutty steely age on the palate. Fine depth of flavour, although the palate does tire very slightly at the end. Really on very good form. ****",wine
,wine
Good fruit and depth of colour. Very obvious new oak on the palate. Good drinkable modern wine. ***,wine
,wine
"Fragrant, dry palate, quite meaty and serious.  Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature.  Rather enjoyable. ***",wine
I don't often drink village Chablis. This is a good example of what you get from a good one: all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined.   Best with food. **,wine
"Seems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar, but when it warms up its fantastic: dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth.   Quite structured - it will probably improve a bit yet. Am I being overgenerous with ***(*)",wine
"Quite tight and lean,   I wondered a bit whether it wasn't a little thin when judged by the highest standards, but while not an absolute star, more and more emerged with some breathing.   Very well-defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity.  Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage.  Top ***",wine
"Lovely bright, crisp red fruits.  Excellent concentration and balance, great fruit but bone dry.  Just a lovely village wine, I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that.  Top ***",wine
"Top, top quality. Creamy fruit,  lean, complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage. ****",wine
Very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage. Delicious. A good ***,wine
"Quite rich, forward, exotic fruit.   Drinking nicely.  This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight, and then thawed - didn't seem to have done much damage, and as my host remarked it's an easy way of opening the bottle. **",wine
"Pure, quite mineral,  the fact that this is a ""no new oak"" wine very pleasingly evident.  Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too, specially once it had been open for half an hour.   Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer.   Nice wine.  Bare ***",wine
,wine
"Understated, quite complex, but a little flat and dominated by a caramel/toffee overlay that I'm not keen on.   Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this, but on this showing I'm not wildly keen. **",wine
"Dull, very deep-coloured and tending to oxidation.  Nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely.  An early case of ""poxy white Burgundy"" or just a dodgy cork? Not Rated",wine
"Attractive and drinkable, but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently. ***",wine
Pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon. Bare ***,wine
"Writing up my notes from visiting D-J in Rully persuaded me to open this, brought back from their cellars.",wine
"Bright, attractive and authentic, but lacking any special buzz.  I wrote that on initially drinking a glass or two: returning the following night this has opened out and is showing lovely minerality.   Scrapes ***(*)",wine

From a magnum (well it was New Year's Eve). I think I've had this bottle for five plus years. Lovely stuff - beautifully balanced. Could still have used a few more years. A very easy ****,wine

"Deep colour, very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms. Evolved. Quite bold and rich.  Long and delicious, provided you like the meaty, not so elegant, Bollinger style - it's not everyones glass of bubbles.  Top ****",wine
Quite elegant but rich (some botrytis perhaps).  Very fine.  ***(*),wine
"Mineral, nice fruit, dry and taught.  Starting to drink nicely.  Bare ****",wine
"Deep colour, rather lovely, gentle, long, mellow, nutty and delightful.  Some say a little lacking poise or complexity but I quite like it.   ***",wine
"Pure, quite light and aetherial (the vineyard perhaps).  Nice length and texture. Pleasingly little oak. Still improving but may be won't merit another star.  Pretty good.  ***",wine
"Dusty, quite large but dry. Tending towards baked (typical of the vintage) - a little chunky. Still pretty good. Quite a Clarety style of Burgundy. Bare ***(*)",wine
"Closed at first, but opens out - lovely pure raspberry fruit. High-toned. Very long. Needs a few more years to peak.  ****(*)",wine
"Dry, nice, savoury,  but time to drink.  Top ***",wine
"Colour tending to brown.  Quite animal,  rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying. **",wine
"Amazing dense young colour. Floral, mineral, tobacco. Iodine finish.  Very fine indeed.  *****",wine
"Mineral nose, rich cherry fruit hot iron finish.  Fantastic interest - packed with ripe tannins. Great balance - but lots of potential. Top ****(*)",wine
"Very easy, silky, forward. Touch of class.  I would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age. ***",wine
"Apricot fruit, creamy texture and flavour. No great complexity (typical  of Eiswein).  Lovely acidity. Bare ****",wine
"As it opens up, rather fine - raspberry fruit, touch of chocolate, a bit spirity towards the end.  Moderate weight now. Top ****",wine
"Very fresh, lots of fizz. Touch of yeast, etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the Bolly.  In spectacularly good condition and with fine, precise bready flavours. Lovely Top ****",wine
,wine
From a half. Its usual reliable self - fine bubbles and good medium-weight balance. ***,wine
"From a half. Simple and charming. I love claret like this, especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related. This is at peak and a pleasure to drink. ***",wine
OK stuff with decent fruit. A touch coarse. **,wine
"Beautiful. Especially after a bottle of indifferent Prosecco drunk with candied(?) hibiscus flowers in the glass. The Lynch-Bages is elegant, and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming. Hints of peach kernel and tempered steel. ****",wine
Poor alongside the Lynch-Bages. Too soft and undemanding. ***,wine
This needs a bit more time. Good structure and supple tannins - medium length. A good ***,wine
,wine
"Brought round by a friend for a Sunday lunch. A slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened, but this cleared to reveal a light-to-medium weight claret with classic cigar box. ***",wine
,wine
"Rich vanilla fruit, excellent concentration.  Not the last word in elegance and the mousse is a bit coarse - but overall a splendid wine.  At least a good ***(*)",wine
"Fruitcakey Claret, quite big and robust - seems a little woody at first but returning a day later it's clean, nicely-toned mature wine.   Chunky and in the final analysis not that complex, but good. ***",wine
,wine
"Vanillan, lovely mousse,  very elegant.  Understated class. ****",wine
"Rich, good riesling character, quite a lot of residual sugar.  Good in its way. ***",wine
"Lovely fresh fruit.  Complex, delicate nose. Falls off a bit in the mouth.   Opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines.  This is one of their lesser wines - it's a credit to the property. ***",wine
"Rich, lively, smoky, very nice. Less fine than the Cubillo but richer.  (From a half.) ***",wine
"Inky, tannic, plummy, a bit baked. Lovely secondary characters merging.  ***(**)",wine
"Suaver, rounder, suggestive of Pomerol.  Pure and a touch  higher-toned than the Barton.  Not ready but a bit shorter-term too. Top ***(*)",wine
"Terribly refined, mature Claret. Great breed and balance.  I sometimes find Pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes, but this is a super wine. ****",wine
Nice old nose. A touch of tea - good but doesn't develop on the palate. Creamy vanilla.  Just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass. ***,wine
"Gamy,mineral yet edgy and unbalanced.  Interesting yet also slightly flawed. Possibly a dodgy bottle.  Top  ***",wine
"Rich, limey fruit.  Young-seeming. Apple finish. Excellent - marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background.  Top ***",wine
A touch pruney and hard - opens up a bit but remains  a bit unsatifyingly remote.   I would expect more.   ***,wine
"Fresh, fragrant raspberry nose. Fine, elegany, light palate. Joyfully lovely. *****",wine
,wine
"Elegant as always, silky-testured drinking wine.  but I don't feel this has the power for long-term evolution that (say) the 1990 has.  Drinking nicely now. Top ***",wine
Drinking (from a half) really beautifully now.  A delight. ****,wine
"I recall being a bit disappointed last time I drank one of these magnums.   This one however is delightful, mature, berryish St Emilion.   Breed and balance to the fore.  Very good drinking. Top ***",wine

"Funky, showing age, substantial but odd. ***",wine
"Nicely integrated, a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality. Top ***",wine

,wine
"Clean, dry, attractive. Very drinkable. **",wine
,wine
"Very pure, high-toned yet silky fruit.  Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses, tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins.   On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old-fashioned Bordeaux.  Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well-made it is a pleasure to drink now. Top ***",wine
,wine
"Perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit, quite dry-seeming now with a bit of Pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness.  Pleasant enough. **",wine

"Yeasty, quite meaty. Rich. Needs a few years.  I haven't had a recently purchased bottle of Pol for a while and was surprised by its weight. Good though. ***",wine
"Lovely sous-bois and blackberry  nose,  silky fruit, ripe (in the modern style) with succulent, tannins.   Rather classy in a fairly modern way. (A quick thrash onGoogle reveals this one some sort of IWC trophy - I can understand that.)  Not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare ***(*)",wine
"Iodine and iron, rich, decadent, fleshy.  Fruitcake fruit.   Good, and time to drink. Bare ****",wine

"Quite big, a touch flabby, rather evolved and vegetal. I'm not sure what combination of producer, vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this, being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case.   Still pretty drinkable.  Bare ***",wine
"Lightweight, feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food.  Modest acidity, and so I am not sure how long this is for keeping.  Very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level. Top ***",wine

"Really nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be, quite big but in balance.   No hint of the problems of the vintage.  Top ***",wine
"The second bottle of H. Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently.  This is so pure, digestible and generally fine, but understated - it doesn't shout and it doesn't have a particular note of individuality for me.   Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot.   Beginning to drink well, but not a long-haul wine.   Top ***",wine

"Notably off-dry still, very fresh with rounded, attractive fruit. Good. ***",wine
"Lovely apple and cream nose, slightly honied and a touch of yeast.  Fine mousse too. Lovely.  A 93/94/95 blend I believe.   Top ****",wine
"That old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely. Very fresh, nicely rounded fruit.  Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good. Bare ****",wine
"Good intensity, the fruit has a distinct character: mineral, not fruit-driven, something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit.  Very engaging.  Top ***",wine
"Very gentle, completely resolved, pleasantly enjoyable. ***",wine
"All very lovely, but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques, I feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines. ***",wine

Lovely cherry fruit. Very attractive. ***,wine
"Good Syrah character, fruit-driven but not to the point of undrinkability.  Pleasant. Scrapes **",wine
"Substantial and weighty, notable botrytis, interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic.  This was just a taste -I'd be interested to try more. ***",wine
"Fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so I guess this is for drinking now.  Creamy, some cigar-box, all in all attractive fruit, but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score. Top ***",wine
"I guess I could get used to this trocken business:  this has good fruit and is bone-dry without being harsh.  Still fairly moderate alcohol at 12%, the overall balance is good.  A year or two short of its peak, I suspect. ***",wine
"Blackberry fruit, some oak I think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak. Modern-style. **",wine
"An interesting expression of the Langhe, if with a modern tinge of new oak. Everything Conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception. On the other hand I can't feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his Barolos are.  A mix of four grape varietoes including Nebbiolo. Bare ***",wine
"Round berry fruit, quite a lot of blackcurrant, some tobacco.   Very nice mature Claret, if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine. Good though. ***",wine
Quite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle Soave charcter and pure fruit very evident.  Good length too. Top **(*),wine
This is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity. Delicious. ****,wine
"My last bottle of this.  It's really a relaxed, fully mature, attractive and balanced wine.  Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance.  Very good.  I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12.5% alcohol. ***",wine
"Very classy, pure, blackberry and apple fruit.   Demanding but ripe tannins, very succulent.   Really good Dolcetto. ***",wine
"Spritzy from dissolved CO2 I guess.  Excellent richness of fruit, intensity and length.   Nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity. At least ***(*)",wine
"Lovely bright appetising Mosel wine, yet with a rich fruitiness. Very attractive. Top ***",wine
The second time I've tried this recently.  It's an Ozzie-like Cabernet Syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate.   Seems to get better the longer it is open. Fine wine. ***,wine
A dry dark Oloroso-like palate - what a P.C. ought to have I guess but I often find them more Amontillado there too as well as on the nose.  Rather good.  15 years old according to their web site.   Top ***,wine

Spicy riesling petrolly nose. Pretty dry - good length.  But fairly simple and light.   *,wine
Again petrolly - rather richer.   Quite good concentration. Dry.  I wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly.  **,wine
Honey and caramel. Butter.  Less intense on the palate. Good **,wine
Less ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense. ***,wine
Unusually intense vanilla nose. Damp straw - quite heavy-textured.  **,wine

Minty.  Similar - finishes a bit abruptly.  **,wine
Minty.   A bit toffeed. High-toned. I'm not wild about this.   **,wine

"Dry, pure, well-made. Balanced. ***",wine
Liquour raspberry again.  A bit thick. Softer and lacking the attack of the 2001. **,wine
Hints at mint again.  Oddly twisty. Yet more balanced than the Chileans. **,wine
"Quite fresh, fruity, straw-like. High-toned. Rather nice.  ***",wine
Pleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat.  Top **,wine
"I spent the day moving paving slabs (heavy and intense) and making fish stock (light and intense). The stock was poured over some cod, sea bass, spinach and creme fraiche (this isn't Fine Wine Dairy, but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche) and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan. Stroganoff, excellent cheeses from the Cambridge Cheese Company and a passion fruit tart from Maison Blanc in Oxford (that my daughter was very passionate about) followed.",wine
Good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire. Medium weight and with a hint of oxidation. Top ***,wine
Rather simple after the de Venoge - lighter weight. Some complexity emerges after a while in the glass. ***,wine
"This was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin-end offers: the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule. However, the wine inside was lovely. This was as tight a Riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity. A really fine effort with time ahead. ***(*)",wine
"One of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special. Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple. None of the Âtypical Talbot whiff of the barnyard' that Broadbent notes, but rather, on this showing, a wine of great purity and lasting structure. Superb, and at a glorious peak. *****",wine
"From magnum. I guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine (I rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order). This is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry, coffee and chocolate overtones. Good claret that, enjoyable though it is (I am drinking it whilst typing these notes), gets relegated, for now, to the luncheon division. A good ***",wine
"From a half. Delicious and aging rather well. Good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet, but which is contained within the framework of the wine. I think this will age into something truly great. ****(*)",wine

Showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length. ****,wine
"Like a Viognier almost, nicely intense. Top **",wine
"Pure black-cherry fruit in profusion. Good concentration and so on, with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines.  How will this age I wonder? Probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste.  Top ***",wine
"Fragrant, lightweight (a very poor vintage of course), no very great length, needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish.  Top ***",wine
"Meatier, longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak. Again so individual and so much a terroir wine.  I love it. Bare ****",wine

"This has rather a baked fruit character that I am not so keen on.  It is hard to taste against great wines like the Gentaz, but only a top **",wine
"Fragrant, dry and long.  More mineral and complex than the other Ogier wines.   Really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the Gentaz wines that tend to upstage it. ****",wine
"An absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two.  Tremendous weight, and concentrated minerality but all in balance.  Fantastic.  Top *****",wine
Needs a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic Cote Rotie violets emerge.   Very good. Top ***,wine
"This has a solid core of fruit, and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess. It is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however. Bare *****",wine
"Fragrant, balanced, easy-going wine with a nice dry finish. Good ***",wine
Corked. Not Rated,wine
Awkwardly dry and rather short.  Would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great - hardly surprising given the vintage. Top **,wine
Asian spices (as R.P. so often says).  Fresh (almost youthful still) with fantastically long fruit. Gorgeous. Top *****,wine
Oxidised - might be an odd bottle so I won't rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way. Not Rated,wine
More awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance. But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced. Intellectual wine and really good. *****,wine
"More open and leafy, lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful. ****",wine
Top stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer. Top ***,wine
"Mineral, broad, intense with a restrained, crystalline purity.  Brilliant. *****",wine

Pale tangerine colour in a decanter.  Intensely gingery on the nose (as Ramonet's wines often are) but to a grotesque degree.  Rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way.  A day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness. No Stars,wine

"According to the front label 'An original blend of 95% SYRAH'; according to the back label a 'wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes, goat's cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses' and 'Suitable for vegetarians and vegans'. Unlike the labelling, the wine isn't too contrived. Good balance and good red fruit depth. It will probably improve with a few years age. By the way, the other 5% is Mouvedre [sic]. Just **(*)",wine
I wasn't expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones. What a revelation though! Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate. A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays. ****,wine

"Good old fizz with touches of honey, wood and aniseed. Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together. ****",wine
"A disappointing wine in some sense. Quite winey, and doesn't really have the class one expects. Relatively (for a big name from '96) rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future. Possibly an off form bottle. **(*)",wine

"Not a star village, an un-rated vineyard and a moderate vintage - it's amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve.  Lovely, drinkable, engaging, characterful and not entirely simple fuit - nine years old and about at peak from a half.  Really very enjoyable. ***",wine
"Dense colour.  Quite Syrah-like at first, but more baked (almost burnt) plum fruit after a while.   Good texture - feels nice in the mouth.  Good structure too - this is a rather good, characterful wine.   Still improving and needing time, but perhaps it won't actually quite rate more stars. ***",wine

"Healthy colour - cedary, fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate. Pretty much at peak, but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too.  I haven't always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate, but this has shifted my opinion up a bit. ***",wine
"Very pleasantly cedary, but this Bordeaux-style wine's fruit is becoming a bit thin now.  **",wine

"I haven't tasted this for eight years, I think.   I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich, extravagently viscous texture. There's a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish.

"My first sampling of Jadot's Beaujolais project.  My first thought was that I was expecting something a bit larger, but the fruit has good, under-stated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too.

"The Lamaione is a disappointing wine. I remember having it for the fist time (before FWD, in 1995 or earlier I guess). Then it oozed class, and in 1997 I still rated it highly. But since then it has declined, and now one word will do: 'undrinkable' - although I've expanded slightly beyond that below. I wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making (carb. mac.?). There aren't many wines I've poured down the sink, but this was one of them.",wine
Harsh and astringent. Completely gone. No Stars,wine

This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it's just a mistage to try and drink these wines young.  Very top ***",wine

"Only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage. Still very fresh, nutty and autolytic - really yeasty on the nose.   Drier and tighter than the GA 97 too - lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too. Complex finish.  Lovely. Scrapes  *****",wine
"Red wine made from Pinot Noir, of course. Fairly complex nose, bone dry - seems a bit flat and old on the mid-palate. All the interest is on the nose.  Rather dull in the mouth.  If fizz could be made with these grapes, then this is a bit of a waste except that it gives some insight into the nature of fruit that makes good Champagne.   Bare **",wine
"Very mushroom and truffle - and hinting at maderisation.  Curious indeed,  and not entirely positively. Old beyond its years - is it an odd bottle? The guy from Bollinger says not, but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine.  Perhaps having this after desert was a poor idea (I did think of leaving my pud until later) and I wouldn't be surprised if there is more to this wine than I found.  For now, the interest on the nose scrapes ****",wine

"The things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles I seem to recall.  I opened one with trepidation but no need: actually a healthy light colour and a lovely, fresh, tar and roses Barolo nose.  The fruit had that underlying sweetness that good Barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins.   Not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking.   ***",wine
"I have oscillated a bit about this 100% Gargenega wine.   It is Ca Rugate's interpretation of what old Soave might have been like, I seem to recall.   It has a deep colour (from skin contact, I think) and a broad, flat, mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose. It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction: Massa Vecchia and Gravner.   It is rather less grand than either (and a bit cheaper)  but I like it, and I think time is making it more interesting. ***",wine
"Intense strawberry nose, solid, concentrated  fruit, quite dry as often with Lafarge. A touch of Italianate bitterness and quite firm tannins make it rather a food wine at the moment.   I hope that rawness wears off - I think it will.   ***(*)",wine
Surprisingly high-toned almost Amontillado-like nose. Palate has warm raisiny character and a nice texture. ***,wine

"Rather good fruit, oak fairly evident on the palate but probably not excessive (although I must say I like less and less oak in my wines),  quite mineral too.  Could do with a bit longer in bottle but probably won't make four stars as it seems just a bit simple by the highest standards. ***",wine

"This bottle has been shouting 'drink me, drink me!' for the last couple of years - eyeing me up each time I opened the cellar. I had it last in 1999, when it was disappointing. This time though it was a glorious claret with warm, pencil-shaving nose and palate. I'm glad I've resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best.

"Opened with trepidation given Toby's recent article ablout 1996 white Burgundy. This one, however, was fine. Elegant, light to medium bodied and with good use of oak. Good texture to the wine. Possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best. ****",wine
"I don't know whether to score this wine or not. When first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness. However, returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present, but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge. I am now drinking the rest of the bottle as I type. Again, when I first took the cork out (a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night) a corky edge lurked within the wine. But it disappeared! As had the oxidised edge! The wine I am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay. Wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold (see the note for Pichon '92 below). But this wine seems to be living in reverse (if I left it another few days I'd probably end up with a bunch of grapes). Quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine (they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when I poured the last glass from the bottle). Scored as it is now drinking: top ***",wine

"I have quite a lot of this wine, and I have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether I needed to rush to drink it up. On this bottle's showing, I need not have too many worries about that. Not quite up to the standard of the previous wine (it somehow lacks the breeding), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together. No rush to drink up. ****",wine

"Very nice - mineral, classic Claret.  Lovely balance right through.   For drinking. Top ***",wine
Medium weight with a lovely savoury palate and a touch (not unpleasant now they are resolved) of the vintages tannins. I like this a lot - probably has more time left than the 81.  Bare ****,wine
"Very nicely classic.  Cigar box and sweet, ripe fruit nose.   Follows through nicely with a high-toned palate.  Bare ****",wine
"A bit faded, but alive and quite pleasant - splendid effort for the vintage.  Very drinkable.  From a half.  Top **",wine
Intriguing brown-sugar nose with lots of mineral terroir notes.   Very classic and savoury - gorgeous.  Returning to it:  walnut nose and the palate too is like licking one.  High-toned again.   Really splendid but still needs time. *****(*),wine
"Classic, quite austrere and high toned - very 66.   Good length too, but it seems just very slightly corked.  Clearly excellent, but I'll not rate it.  Not Rated",wine
Stunning mix of flavours - quite fascinating.  Hints at an edgy volatility too.  Delicious but needs drinking - it may be a bit unstable. Top ****,wine
Perfectly balanced mature Claret - So mineral.  An absolute pleasure from beginning to end. *****,wine
"Stands out above the last two wines with an amazing extra depth and huge complexity.  Suave, yet dry.  Very, very long.  No hurry to drink. ******",wine

Corked.  Not Rated,wine
Hopelessly oxidised - surely an odd bottle.  Not Rated,wine

"Exotic coconut nose, creamy.   Not Claret as we know it, but fascinating.   There's great depth and structure and so this probably will be stunning in a while.  Bare ****(*)",wine
Young wine cassis - but Montrose minerality too.  Fairly ripe - it seems in a slightly softer more modern style than the later wines in this flight. Good though.   ***,wine
Liquid minerals and excellent fruit.  Very good and will be lovely.  ***(*),wine
"Very dense - a cross between 98 and 90.   Qute a monster, but perhaps some of the older wines were that way in their youth. Still, this will surely be lovely in ten years. ***(**)",wine
Mineral again but a bit more restrained and classic - less exotic than the 96.   I like it a lot - almost more than the 96 - very stylish and balanced.  ***(**),wine
"A blend of 91, 90 and 89.  Apple and mushroom nose and palate - very meaty and substantial.  Big finish. ****",wine

"Floral, suggestions of warm hay.  Light, refreshing, noticably off-dry. **",wine
"A single vineyard wine. Floral, richer and better delineated than the basic wine. Very drinkable. ***",wine
A special selection from various vineyards. Dumb on the nose with some yeasty notes. Very much demi-sec but nicely balanced with a rich palate. ***,wine

Still Prosecco - it does seem rather featureless! *,wine
"A passito wine made from Prosecco grapes and bottled from a Solera established in 1991 (this example bottled in 2003).  Banana nose, elegant, attractive palate. Very nice. At least ***",wine
"The usual zoo - bottles everywhere, great fun.   The notes are consequently quite brief and impressionistic.",wine

A domaine in Quintaine (Macon). Charming and easy - in the best sort of way.  A great advert for basic Burgundy.  **,wine
"Delightful.  Time to drink this, I think. ***",wine
"Intense, sherberty, rather closed - needs time.  At least **(*)",wine

Pure and elegant but very gutless and lacking complexity. Disappointing.   A sign that Jaboulet is losing it? **,wine

Not the best bottle - woody  taint. Still fine. I'd give this three stars but I know it's an even better wine. Not Rated,wine
"Ice-cream - lovely, dry, piquant  palate - intense.  Quite tannic.  Perhaps ****",wine
Luxury pudding wine - fresh (disgorged 2003 I believe).   Complex and lovely though I wonder if it would be better Brut.  A taste of how Champagne was a century ago. Top ***,wine
Pleasant old thing - without being particularly striking.  ***,wine

"Like all the Gravner whites, a deep golden colour quite unlike most modern white wines. Jammy nectarine nose, rather red-wine-like.   Grapey peach palate, long and honied.  Striking and interesting. It has the structure (some tannins) and balance to improve. Lovely. ****(*)",wine
"A little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there's some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved, but I feel that is superficial and I prefer the honied purity of the Ribolla. Excellent again.  ****",wine
"Honied nectarine again, excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch ""flatter"". Still exciting. Bare ****",wine

I don't seem to have tasted so much this year and the notes are hurried.  Too much good conversation!,wine
"Vinous nose, floral and rich fruit.  I Good length, but it does seem very wood-influenced. No dosage, I believe, but it seems well-balanced. ***",wine
"A ""solera wine"" I gather. Yeasty, rather good.   I must try a bottle properly one day. Top ***",wine

"Brioche and honey nose, quite citric (lemon and grapefruit) palate.  A little disjointed still but time will draw it together nicely.   Softly frothy now, as one might expect from its youth.  Very good. ***(*)",wine
Most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago.  I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93+94+95 blend.  Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones.  Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don't find it remotely a problem.  Very rich but now in perfect balance. ****,wine

"Quite pale, rather eveloved (the level is bottom-shoulder which might be the reason).  Rather savoury and delicious but   not quite what it ought to be, I feel.  Top ***",wine
"Very pale, mushrooms and biscuits.  Probably very old (some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850's - if any are, it's this one) and past its best.   **",wine

"Rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee -  not very varietal now, more mineral - some will say too old but I think its at a peak.  Pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine.   Is this just age or is this old-style Zind before the days of extra residual sugar?  Whatever, it's rather nice.  Top ***",wine

Excellent - tropical-edged very lemony fruit. Some oak I think. Nice balance and very rich.  Big - a bit modern but very good.  Aiming at the Beaucastel Rousanne VV style perhaps. ***,wine
Very fizzy to the extent of being a fault.  But  it wears off enough to form a judgement - quite mineral and characterful.  Serious wine that I'd like to try again.  At least a good ***,wine

Still red Pinot Noir from Champagne. So soft and silky.  Gorgeously round.  Easy-going.   One of the best non-Burgundian Pinots I have tasted.   Top  ***,wine
Beetroot fruit - harder than the previous wines.  Very baked and extracted.  This is really not a success. **,wine
Lots of grippy tannins.  Highly-wrought and oaky.  Not my sort of thing - but striking. Certainly needs time but what will happen?  ***,wine
"Very fine - deep, rich, silky with a lovely refined, dry palate.   Splendid for vintage, but could one regret the lack of C-R typicity?  *****",wine
"Rich pineapple, nice acid. Very pleasant. Bare ***",wine
Lighter at the final analysis - although more mouthfilling. Top **,wine
"Bright, both metaphorically and literally. A touch hard on the finish still although coming round to drinking.   A touch short of the richness you might hope for from Grahams in this vintage. Still worth ***(*)",wine

"Acacia, nuts.  Intense, dry, long. Drinking but no hurry.  ****",wine
"Lime, herbs, cream.  Not heavy on the palate - lovely.  Top  ****",wine
Big and muscular - grand cru intensity and rich finish.  Very good.  ***(*),wine
"Fragrant, piquant cranberry,  yet meaty (bovril) nose.  Excellent for the vintage. Partly on the basis of interest -  a bare ****",wine
"Promoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an Australian wine is making a statement.   A touch mineral,  quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated.   Personally, I still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food.   Interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for Australian style might rate a bit more. Still  ***",wine
"Fat, nice botrytis, a touch of paint-stripper and not so long. Good **",wine
"Less intense, less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish. Nice.  ***",wine
"Lightweight yet concentrated.  Ethereal, complex chocolatey fruit.  Lovely.  *****",wine
These three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that FWD isn't always very kind to Beaujolais. I tasted these with LJM (sometime contributor to FWD). I'm afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about Beaujolais. But they have persuaded me that I need to try a few more.,wine
"Earthy, fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate. My favourite of the three wines for drinking now. ***",wine
I'm afraid I couldn't really get on with this wine - it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end. Possibly a faulty bottle so I won't score Not Rated,wine
"Quite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy I guess. Initially a bit dumb and subdued, but after time the wine opened out. It would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase. For now ***",wine
,wine
"Excellent condition at 10 years old, very good fruit too, although for some reason I could not get that excited about it.  Still a decent ***",wine
"My last bottle of this - and hasn't it kept well.   Completely fresh but fully mature, quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable. ***",wine
Very juicy with a touch of Italianate bitterness to give it a grown-up appeal.  Finishes a touch abruptly perhaps. A good *,wine
"A glass at Valvona's Vincafe, even so clearly very elegant, refined, blanced and generally yummy. ***",wine
"Very classy, loads of fruit, fairly forward, drinking very nicely. Top ***",wine
"On opening, quite tough - you have to like tannins for this.  It does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out.  Delicious.  Easy ***",wine
"This guy is one hell of a winemaker.  This has concentrated tarry raspberry fruit on the nose, bags of tannins (which are ripe enough to be enjoyable even at this stage), super concentration and texture and a long finish.  High-toned, despite being a bit more forward than the 96.  Excellent. Easily ***(*)",wine
"Written from memory a day or two later: surprisingly old-fashioned orange-rimmed colour.  Quite forward and easy-going, drinking OK at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters.   Very classy.   ***",wine

"Quite dry, fairly austere but very good, particularly with some nibbles. Bare ***(*)",wine
"More forward and fragrant, not really noticably sweeter.   Good ***",wine
"This is half Chardonnay and half Pinot Meunier - the latter not that apparent. Very yeasty, seems a bit four-square at the moment (perhaps that is where one sees the P-M). Rich and really very  long.   Clearly need quite a lot of time,  and I can see it could well be very good in a decade or so, although it might be a bit light on finesse.  Bare **(**)",wine
"Curious - very exotic, vanillan, and highly vinous.  Not everyones idea of Champagne,  but you can't say it lacks character. I need to drink this over an evening (with food) and see how my relationship with it develops.  For now a top  ***",wine
"Dry,  real Puligny, quite intense.  Not special but it does what it says on the tin.  ***",wine
"Quite rich, mouthfilling wine.  Lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars. Top ***",wine
"Nice fruit - pure, intense. ***",wine
A bit more oaky - but quality fruit again.  ***,wine
Seepage round the cork (under the capsule).   Odd but not undrinkable - clearly faulty. Not Rated,wine
"Depths, depths and more depths.   Really lovely, both rich and piquant. Very top ***(*)",wine
"Burnt, dense, exotic, meaty.   Tannic.  Austere, difficult.  This might yet come good, and even now it is arresting and interesting drinking.   Risky to rely on it evolving well, but if all goes well  ***(*)",wine
"Attractive green rim - never a bad sign.   On the palate, like a really fine old Madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate.  The flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink.   Top ***",wine
Chocolatey fruit - very nice old Colheita. Top ***,wine
,wine
"Possibly a touch too old now, but lovely old Champagne nonetheless. Mature and elegant for its depth. ****",wine
"One of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping. I love old white Burgundy, and this didn't let me down. Lovely, oily, nutty ethereal stuff. ****",wine
"Disappointing. Not past it, but just not particularly special. Maybe it still needs loads more time to develop? **",wine
Lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose. Drinking very well. Silky. *****,wine
"OK, so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage. The label wasn't in the best condition. The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982. The last time I had this wine I was disappointed, and I was again this time. It's OK, but it hasn't got the structure or depth expected. ***",wine

"Stylish nose, slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate. Pleasant. *",wine
"Slightly flat, flavoursome,  a bit rustic. Interesting, up to a point.  *",wine
Rich fruit. Lovely Burgundy.   Good intensity and structure.  Needs time.  Top ***(*),wine
Mothbally at first. Disjointed but intense palate.  Emerges - needs  time.  Will be great I suspect. ***(**),wine
"Honied nose, strong palate.  Quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years, I suspect.   Even unflawed 96's seem to be aging quite quickly.  ****",wine
"Open,  peachy, luxurious. A little light, some thought, but I loved it.  ****",wine
"Cough-sweet and smoky. Interesting, but slightly harsh on the finish.  perhaps needs time. ***(*)",wine
"Grenachey,  cassis overtones - quite raw finish.  A bit rubbery.  **",wine
"Caramel nose.  A touch rough,  perhaps.   Opens out - quite classically chateauneuf. Top ***",wine
"Nice balance,  clearly warm-vintage. A lovely balance of slavours.   Coming round to drinking quite fast.  A good ****",wine
Yummy drinkability. Stands up in this company - if a bit simple.  ***,wine
"Fragrant nose.  Gummy, rich, very fine.  ****",wine
"A touch woody.  Pleasant, persistent, but perhaps a bit thin.  Bare ***",wine

My memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good: Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box.   Very much a point and it has kept well.  A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property.   Good effort - I'd like to try some other vintages. ***,wine
"Quite concentrated and flavoursome, but lacking finesse for me in a way that I'm not sure more time will alleviate.  PLeasant then but not  fantastic. ***",wine
Smoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable. ***,wine
"Blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours, very stylish indeed.   Will probably improve for a year or two.  ***",wine
"A bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains.  Still, quite a dense, brown-sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something.   Good rather than exceptional. ***",wine
"Fruity, grassy - like a new world semillon.  Pleasant enough. *",wine
Nice fruit quality - quite suave.  Decent length.  Top *,wine
Very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay.  Very refined texture and good length.   Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian.  It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding.  Scrapes ****,wine
"Slate, sherbert, a touch sour as MSR wines can be.  Good length, maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something I find occasionally with the vintage.  Fine, but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain.  Top ***",wine
"Quite tight and closed, but opens out with time as it warms up.  Excellent intensity and a long brioche finish.  Good balance.  ****(*)",wine
Very thin and dull.  Drinkable but No Stars,wine
,wine
"Modern-styled, but very nicely done.   Limey acidity.  Satisfying, but completely upstaged by the Jobard that follows.  ***",wine
"More reserved, but much more complexity and ""beyond-fruit"" flavours.   Excellent.  ***(*)",wine
"Dry, reserved, quite persistent. Rather good.  Bare ***(*)",wine
Oxidised - but it did have a slightly loose cork. Not Rated,wine
Softer and rounder than the Lafarge below.  Still quite piquant on the palate.   ***,wine
"Dry, fragrant, good length.  Fairly austere at first and less flattering than the Jadot wine.  Might till improve touch, while the Jadot is ready.  ***",wine
Open 24 hours.  Seems good. Quite mineral.  ***,wine

"Sold to me in Oddbins as the wine that beat Dom Perignon in a recent competition. Actually it might have been the NV Blin that did this - different assistants in Oddbins attributed the result to both wines. This wine is good, but not DP good. There's a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand. **(*)",wine
Good strawberry nose and pleasantly elegant palate. ***,wine
Drinkable. *,wine
,wine
"Rich, quite forward (sepcially for the vintage), the quality shows in the persistence.  Lovely Juniper/Gin edge to the nose. ****",wine
"A belnd of 95 and 96. Strawberry fruit, impressive at first but it does seem simple compared to the Deutz.   Weighty but not so intense.  Good though for the price.  ***",wine
Quite varietal but with an added complexity and some non-fruit chatracter that makes it stand out.  Drinking very nicely. Top ***,wine
Lighter and a touch vegetal.  A touch thin but nevertheless it is a wine of character. Top **,wine
"Richer again, as with the 93 you might struggle to spot the grape variety: no bad thing in my mind.  An interesting mature wine ***",wine
"Very fine, very characteristically Southern Rhone. Top ***",wine
"Really quite Northern Rhone-like and very stylish, gamy Syrah. ****",wine
"Very complex, smoky wine.  Really lovely. Scrapes *****",wine
"Gamy but elegant.  A little overawed by the Rayas wines, but fine. Bare ****",wine
"Balanced and rich, but perhaps not showing ideally now.  A little more time might help. Still ****",wine
"Very creamy but not rich.   Dies a bit in the glass.   Interesting, and pretty good for an average vintage, vineyard, etc. Top **",wine
Difficult on opening - gamy almost and austere.  Opens out nicely. Top ***,wine
Nicely set up and needing a bit of time yet.   I feel this hasn't the fineness to be great but it is very good.  ***(*),wine
